Plant and Soil. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11104-025-07807-7\nTitle: Plant STOP1 family: a helmsman in the soil multiple stress adaptation\nAuthors: Shurui Zhang, Yanlin Wang, Yao Lu, Shuai Yuan, Long Wang, Lei Xu, Keke Yi, Xianqing Jia\nAbstract: Abiotic stresses significantly reduce crop yields worldwide, with common stressors including drought, flooding, hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, as well as proton and heavy metal toxicity. STOP1 (Sensitive to Proton Toxicity 1) and its homologs were initially found to function as key transcription factors in regulating plant tolerance to both low pH and aluminum toxicity. Recently, increasing evidence has revealed additional roles of STOP1 in coping with multiple environmental stresses, including enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus uptake efficiency, remodeling root architecture, boosting hypoxia tolerance via physiological regulation, negatively regulating drought resistance by modulating water loss, and increasing salt tolerance under low potassium conditions. These findings highlight the significant potential of STOP1 as a key target for improving crop tolerance to diverse environmental stresses. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the central roles of STOP1 and its underlying mechanisms in regulating multiple stress responses. We also propose further work that might help uncover the roles of STOP1 in soil multiple stress adaptation in plants and its application in crop improvement. A deeper understanding of the pleiotropic role of the STOP1 family in plant stress response will help us to systematically understand the resistance mechanism of crops and improve crop performance.\nNews:\nOverview of STOP1 family in regulating plant multi-stress response\nThe STOP1 gene regulates responses to multiple environmental stresses, including proton stress, heavy metal stress (particularly aluminum toxicity), low phosphate stress, heat stress, oxidative stress, flood stress, and drought stress. By activating different downstream response mechanisms, STOP1 helps plants adjust their growth and survival under adverse conditions.\n","permalink":"https://jialab.life/congrats-to-shurui-and-others/","tags":["STOP1","Root growth","Abiotic stress","Review"],"title":"Congrats to Shurui and others!"},{"categories":["Publications"],"contents":" Jia, X., Xu, Z., Xu, L., Frene, J.

Frene, Mathieu Gonin, Long Wang, Jiahong Yu, Gabriel Castrillo, Keke Yi\nAbstract: Besides playing a crucial role in plant immunity via the nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related (NPR) proteins, increasing evidence shows that salicylic acid (SA) can also regulate plant root growth. However, the transcriptional regulatory network controlling this SA response in plant roots is still unclear. Here, we found that NPR1 and WRKY45, the central regulators of SA response in rice leaves, control only a reduced sector of the root SA signaling network. We demonstrated that SA attenuates root growth via a novel NPR1/WRKY45-independent pathway. Furthermore, using regulatory network analysis and mutant characterization, we identified a set of new NPR1/WRKY45-independent regulators that conservedly modulate the root development and root-associated microbiota composition in both Oryza sativa (monocot) and Arabidopsis thaliana (dicot) in response to SA. Our results established the SA signaling as a central element regulating plant root functions under ecologically relevant conditions. These results provide new insights to understand how regulatory networks control plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses.\nNews: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/SjGY7Zi4z8QtqvqHmHaGJg (in Chinese)\nA working model of the regulatory network controlling salicylic acid (SA)-mediated plant root growth and microbiome colonization\nSalicylic acid attenuates root growth via a nonexpressor of pathogenesis-related 1 (NPR1) and WRKY45 (NW) -independent pathway, which mediates SA signaling in regulations of both root growth and microbiome colonization. The NPR1 and WRKY45-dependent regulation of SA response controls only a reduced sector of the root SA signaling network and is involved in shaping root-associated microbiome colonization.\n","permalink":"https://jialab.life/our-first-paper-at-nwu-was-published-in-jipb-now/","tags":["Salicylic acid","Root growth","Microbiota"],"title":"Our first paper at NWU was published in JIPB now!"},{"categories":["Events"],"contents":" Since Oct. 2023, we have settled down at Northwest Univesity, Xi'an.
